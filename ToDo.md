* ~~How to remove a container?~~
* Current location: smaller font (50%)
  * Smaller Font (50%) - Wirklich Current Location? Oder ist Module Destination gemeint?
* Does not save "container types" -> change empty weight
  * Could not reproduce
* ~~Filtering on Container overview page is missing~~
* All items & Containers with content: unassigned list: find an item with name (eg water tank) Now you cannot easily find an item to include in another container...
* All items: filter / sorting would be useful!
* ~~Item page description: difficult to type with bluetooth keyboard: often changes cursor to end of text field. Deleting characters: sometimes they appear again.~~
* ~~Item page: amounts: new container: all containers are in random order, better per unique number~~
* ~~Ordering of items in a container not consistent: Genset 1, 2: same items, different order~~
* ~~All fonts: smaller (to 75%?)~~
* ~~Item page: move cold chain checkbox close to text~~
* Work log: Amount negative when removed from container?
* ~~Work log since: not scrollable. Menu -> work log again: resets to normal work log order (e.g. per date)~~
* Export: Print labels: only 1 label shown instead of 2, A5 instead of A6, aligned in middle of page
* Export: print labels -> save as pdf: only 1 label shown, A5 instead of A6, aligned on top. Document name: document.pdf, better to have a recognizable name. Title during saving presumes otherwise...
* Export: print packing lists: only 1 list (print or saved as pdf), does not remember orientation (eg landscape mode), does not remember selected printer.
* Export: Save on disk: not doing anything
* ~~Export: pop? what is this?~~


* Item page, Manufacturer: while typing keeps selecting text -> new characters replacing the current all the time.
* Weight: also include "in kg"
* Change picture: does not work; gallery -> not shown, camera: also 'upload' -> not shown. Previously uploaded: empty
* Checkboxes: smaller
* Pictures of containers not shown
* Find (Ctr-F) does not work
* Work log: shows changes by web app amount 0, instead of 2 (water heaters, red-white marking tape)
* Export: save to disk: gives no output. It does say it is creating and opening a pdf but it can not be found.
* Export: print, printer / save to pdf: works, but only 1 page. Not remembering printer / page orientation. Labels are A6, correct!



# next steps
* Optimize sizes for Galaxy Tab A8 SMX200


* Add configurable default printer per pdf type
* Pdf: print on preconfigured printers


* Input fields: do not always jump to the end
* Add numeric input field with validation

* Analyze: Use TextInputLayout instead of DropdownButton?
