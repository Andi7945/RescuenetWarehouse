# To Discuss

* Pretty sure we need drag and drop for usability
* Description of container - is not planned but in the PDF
* Dangerous Goods in PDF - is it the label? What text should be in the PDF, the remarks? Or a new field?
* Cold chain -> checkbox in label? Or do we have one label which will be defined here?
* How does the PDF Packing List look with multiple dangerous goods?
* Dangerous Goods: IATA Number = UN Number?
* Should the summary list always be printed?
