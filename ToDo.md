~~* How to remove a container?~~
* Current location: smaller font (50%)
  * Smaller Font (50%) - Wirklich Current Location? Oder ist Module Destination gemeint?
* Does not save "container types" -> change empty weight
  * Could not reproduce
~~* Filtering on Container overview page is missing~~
* All items & Containers with content: unassigned list: find an item with name (eg water tank) Now you cannot easily find an item to include in another container...
* All items: filter / sorting would be useful!
~~* Item page description: difficult to type with bluetooth keyboard: often changes cursor to end of text field. Deleting characters: sometimes they appear again.~~
~~* Item page: amounts: new container: all containers are in random order, better per unique number~~
~~* Ordering of items in a container not consistent: Genset 1, 2: same items, different order~~
~~* All fonts: smaller (to 75%?)~~
~~* Item page: move cold chain checkbox close to text~~
* Work log: Amount negative when removed from container?
~~* Work log since: not scrollable. Menu -> work log again: resets to normal work log order (e.g. per date)~~
* Export: Print labels: only 1 label shown instead of 2, A5 instead of A6, aligned in middle of page
* Export: print labels -> save as pdf: only 1 label shown, A5 instead of A6, aligned on top. Document name: document.pdf, better to have a recognizable name. Title during saving presumes otherwise...
* Export: print packing lists: only 1 list (print or saved as pdf), does not remember orientation (eg landscape mode), does not remember selected printer.
* Export: Save on disk: not doing anything
~~* Export: pop? what is this?~~

# next steps

* Add configurable default printer per pdf type
* Pdf: print on preconfigured printers


* Input fields: do not always jump to the end
* Add numeric input field with validation

* Analyze: Use TextInputLayout instead of DropdownButton?
